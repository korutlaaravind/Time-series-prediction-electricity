# Electric Production Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and forecasting project for electric production using time series data. The project employs the SARIMAX model to predict future electricity production while exploring trends, seasonality, and residual components.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to:
1. Analyze historical electric production data.
2. Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
3. Forecast future electricity production values for the year 2018.
4. Provide actionable insights for energy planning and policy-making.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Visualizes historical trends and seasonal patterns in the data.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Breaks the data into components to better understand its structure.
- **SARIMAX Modeling**: Captures both seasonal and non-seasonal patterns for accurate forecasting.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Displays observed and predicted values in a clear and intuitive graph.

## Files in the Repository
- `electric_production_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and code.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- Dataset (to be added or linked if available publicly).

## Observations
- Electricity production shows a consistent upward trend with strong seasonal variations.
- The SARIMAX model provides reliable predictions for the forecasted period (2018).
- Socio-economic factors, population growth, and industrialization may influence the observed trends.

## Future Scope
- Integrate additional variables such as weather conditions or economic indicators.
- Explore alternative forecasting methods like LSTM or Prophet for comparison.
- Develop a web application for interactive exploration and forecasting.
